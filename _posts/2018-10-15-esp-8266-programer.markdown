On the web we can find differents ways to program a ESP-8266 but in this post I'll show you what way it works for me.

## Prerequisites

* You will need a TTL to USB interface (for example FTDI FT232RL) or you could use the Arduino Uno. In this post we'll use the Arduino UNO.
* The Arduino IDE configured for working with ESP-8266. There are a lot of tutorials about this. 

## ESP-8266 in programing mode

Steps to connect:

1. Connect `TX` to `RX`
2. Connect `RX` to `TX`
3. Connect `VCC` and `CH-PD` to `+`
4. Connect `GND` and `GPIO0` to `-`
Run the Arduino IDE and before upload the code you must change to programming mode:
5. Connect and disconnect `Reset` to `-`. You will can see a blue light in the ESP-8266 that will indicate that you are in programming mode.


### Arduino UNO

With arduino you could use the 3,3V as `+`, the `GND` as `-`, and the ports `RX` and `TX` for the transfer.

> NOTE: It's important that you connect permanently the `reset` port to `-` in Arduino for program the ESP-8266.

## Custom Programmer

I've built with a board a programmer with a reset button that will ease the steps indicated before. This is the result.
