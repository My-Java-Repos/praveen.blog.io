A few days ago I passed Professional Scrum Master (PSM I) exam in scrum.org. This post pretends to be a reference path to pass the exam sucessfully based on my personal experience. In my case I had an in-company training but I think that it's possible to pass the exam without classes following next steps:

* Read the Scrum guide carefully one or two times [Link](http://www.scrumguides.org/index.html)
* Take the open assessment so many times as necessary until you get 100% score [Link](https://www.classmarker.com/online-test/start/?quiz=vek54a6ec10658ef)
* Read the Scrum guide once more
* Take the course **Scrum Master Certification Preparation + Mock Exam Questions (Udemy)** without do the two practice sections [Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/scrum-master-certification-preparation-mock-exam-questions-psm-i/)
* Take the next preparation quiz so many times as neccessary until you get almost 85% [Link](https://mlapshin.com/index.php/scrum-quizzes/sm-learning-mode/)
* Now it's time to complete the two practice sections of Udemy course
* Take the real mode quiz [Link](https://mlapshin.com/index.php/scrum-quizzes/sm-real-mode/)
* Now you are ready to pass the exam. You can buy and take te exam in the next link. [Link](https://www.scrum.org/professional-scrum-certifications/professional-scrum-master-assessments)

**Note:** A private or in-company training is a good recomendation to obtain a deep knowledge of Scrum 

Good luck!
