Iâ€™m happy to announce a new design of my personal blog based on a medium style (thanks to [mediumish-theme-jekyll](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll) ). After more than a year with the previous design, I decided to make a renewal with a more modern style. Of course the blog will continue using Jekyll but includes some new functionalities:

* Integration with Mailchimp to send announces when new posts are published
* Integration with Google Analitycs in order to analyze the visits and other statistics

We keep next functionalities from the previous version:

* Comments with Disqus
* Hit counter for each post with a service stored in Pythonanyware
* Statistics page with hits information for each blog entry

I wish you enjoy with the new design!
